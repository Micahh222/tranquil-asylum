	<h2>Reactive machines</h2>
	<p>A type of machine that merely reacts to stimuli in the environment rather than relying on memory storage and previous experiences. There is no growth or improvement with reactive machines, and their perceptual reactions remain dependent on their immediate environment.
	Ex: Deep Blue IBM </p>

<div class="the2">
	<h2>Limited memory</h2>
	<p>These machines only retain memory data briefly but have the ability to record, analyze, and store data from signals within their surroundings. 
	Ex: Self-driving cars that record the speed limit, current mph, distance, and acceleration rate of nearby cars. </p>

<div class="the3">
	<h2>Theory of Mind</h2>
	<p>The mind is constantly creating and modifying mental representations of the world which fuel our expectations based on previous events and memories. AI researchers seek to build computers that imitate human behavior, emotions, thoughts, and intelligence by creating a real-life mental representation model. </p>

<div class="the4">
	<h2>Self-awareness</h2>
	<p>Awareness of the "self" in computers is a controversial concept that AI researchers will most likely never be able to discover due to its unmeasurable and highly subjective nature. Self-awareness is developed when computers are able to independently care for their own needs, maintain a unique sense of identity, and relate to other humans through personal connections.</p>
